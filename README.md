## Differences

<ul>-The upper left balls from the higher stage are slightly differently positioned, since we couldn't find a sprite for them,
which led to having different size, and so, to being in a different place than intended<br>
-The kicker doesn't compress: instead, it just goes down<br>
</ul>
