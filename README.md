#Pinball Project

A replica of the original Pinball.

### The project can be found at: https://github.com/hodure/Pinball <br>The original game can be found at: https://www.retrogames.cz/play_054-NES.php

## Installation

Currently there is no installation required, just open the .exe provided in the download file

### Debug Controls:<br>
	ESC: Close the game
	F1: Draws all shapes and allows mouse joint control
	1: Creates a circle

### Player Controls: <br>
<ul>-Space: selects a player<br>
-Left arrow: left flicker<br>
-Rigth arrow: right flicker<br>
-Down arrow: kicker
</ul>

## Differences

<ul>-The ball doesn't behave as an elastic element (it doesn't bounce), so movement is not the same. To prevent the ball from staying put, the down arrow can
be used to apply a force to it<br>
-The red holes do not suck and spit the ball when it enters in contact with them
-The upper left balls from the higher stage are slightly differently positioned, since we couldn't find a sprite for them,
which led to having different size, and so, to being in a different place than intended<br>
-The kicker doesn't compress: instead, it just goes down<br>
-Not all audios have been implemented or found<br>
-Not all objects interact when the ball goes through them, and not all combos are implemented<br>
</ul>
